    "This paper provides Fortran90 codes for null geodesic calculations, in Kerr Spacetimes (Rotating Black Holes).\n",

    "* Reading the paper... âœ…\n",
    "* Went through the examples in YNOGK and obtained these plots (Fortran).\n",

    "* Wrote ``f2py`` wrappers for one of the six modules.\n",
    "* Code is poorly formatted and ill suited for direct `f2py` conversion. Will require major effort (and more importantly, time) to refactor the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NOTES:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not continuing with the `f2py` conversion. It requries `IDL`, which is proprietary  and the open source version (`GDL`) doesn't work well. The license seems to allow the conversion, but the file is too long to refactor in one go.\n",
    "* A non-programmatic comparison with other papers is a better way to handle this. After all, `YNOGK` is not the only way to approach the Null Geodesic Problem."
