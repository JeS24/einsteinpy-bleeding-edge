## Abstract

<!-- The abstract should be a short description of what the EPE will achieve. -->

In this EPE, I have detailed the plan for implementing a Ray-Tracing module for Kerr and Schwarschild spacetimes, in EinsteinPy.

----
## Detailed description

<!-- This section describes the need for the EPE.  It should describe the existing
problem that it is trying to solve and why this EPE makes the situation better.
It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used and
perhaps some use cases. -->

Our goal with this EPE is to implement a Ray-Tracing module, for Kerr and Schwarschild spacetimes, that does the following:

1. Helps in visualizing space-time distortion in a strong gravity region (here, a Black Hole or BH)
2. Obtains BH shadow in both spacetimes
3. Performs Time-Independent Radiative Transfer:
    1. To visualize Keplerian Disc/Shell with Lensing effect
    2. To calculate associated Intensities for Gravitational Redshift calculations

While we will be working with the aforementioned spacetimes, we aim to keep the module
general to other geometries, as well.

----
## Implementation

<!-- This section lists the major steps required to implement the EPE.  Where
possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which
steps may be optionally omitted.  Where it makes sense, each  step should
include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses. -->


### A. Approaches

There are two main ways to achieve the aforementioned goals:
1. Numerically Integrating the Geodesic Equation (References [1, 2, 3 & 4](????))
2. Implementing a semi-analytical solution, particular to the spacetime (References [5 & 6](????))

A brief comparison of these approaches on relevant factors, is given below:

| Numerical Integration | Analytical Method (Elliptical Functions) |
|:---:|:---:|
| Computationally slower, as each point on the geodesic has to be evaluated | Computationally faster, as arbitrary sections of the geodesic can be computed |
| Usually less accurate (Adaptive meshing can help here) | Spatial accuracy independent of integration step size |
| Usually makes no assumptions on the underlying geometry | Makes several assumptions to make the problem analytically tractable and computationally faster |
| Generalizable to most spacetimes, which is useful for perturbative simulations | Analytical solutions are specific to the spacetime. Since metric and connection must be known in advance, perturbations cannot be handled in a hands-off way
| Handles 3D accretion flow well | Analytical formula for 3D seems complex and computationally intensive to implement |
| Simpler and faster for higher dimensions | Faster in most other computations |
| Can be massively sped up by using parallel programming | Since calculations are implementation (Math) - specific, speed improvements are negligible |
|||

Based on these factors and more importantly, since we require a general module, we should go with a Numerical Solver. As far as computation speed is concerned, parallel programming seems helpful in bridging the gap between the two approaches. To these ends, after an extensive literature review, I have the narrowed down to these papers in Numerical Relativity:

We will be making use of relevant portions of these works, as described below and cited accordingly.

### B. Numerical Integration Strategies

Based on the papers, listed above, we have two strategies for the whole problem:
1. Integrate geodesics and Time-Independent Radiative Transfer ODEs, at each integration step (simultaneously), like `RAPTOR` and `Odyssey` do.
   * Each step is computationally complex.
   * Integration needs to be performed exactly once.
   * Same stepsizes are used for both calculations, making the overall simulation more accurate.
   * GPU/CUDA dependency, through `numba` or `cuPy` may be needed.
2. Integrate geodesics and have a separate sub-module, that integrates Radiative Transfer equations, using the obtained geodesics, like we have done (somewhat) in the current `einsteinpy.metric.Schwarzschild` class or as in `EHT Collab`.
   * Requires another round of integration, but this time, only on the calculated geodesics, instead of the affine parameter space.
   * Will be easier to troubleshoot.
   * In case, one requires only the geodesics (e.g. for plotting geodesics or obtaining the BH Shadow), extra computations will be avoided.
   * `numba` alone should be sufficient.


### C. Background

#### Geometries

We will be working mainly with the Kerr Metric, which is a stationary, exact vacuum solution of the Einstein Field Equations for empty spacetime, around an uncharged, rotating, axisymmetric BH. This is a generalization of the Schwarzschild Metric, that is an EFE solution for an uncharged, non-rotating BH. The rotation of the BH is accounted for, by the Spin Parameter, $a = J/M$ (Angular Momentum / Mass). Under proper scaling of units (Geometrized Units, for example), $0 \le a \le 1$. In the $a \to 0$ limit, we recover the Schwarzschild Metric. As such, a single module for Kerr Null Geodesics can be extended to Schwarzschild Null Geodesics, by simply setting $a = 0$.

The Kerr Metric is usually given in Boyer-Lindquist Coordinates (`BL`), but one other useful coordinate system is Modified Kerr-Schild Coordinates (`KS`). We already have an implementation for Boyer-Lindquist Coordinates in `einsteinpy.coordinates`. We can implement Modified Kerr-Schild similarly.


#### Geodesic Equation

The Geodesic Equation is a numerically stiff second order ODE, which can be derived by maximizing the action in 4D spacetime, using variational methods. It can be written succinctly using Christoffel Symbols ($\Gamma _{{bc}}^{a}$), as follows (N.B: Einstein Summation has been used throughout this document):

$${\frac  {d^{2}X^{a}}{d\lambda^{2}}}+\Gamma _{{bc}}^{{a}}{\frac  {dX^{b}}{d\lambda}}{\frac  {dX^{c}}{d\lambda}}=0 \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\dots(1)$$
$$\Gamma _{{bc}}^{a}={\frac  {1}{2}}g^{{ad}}\left(g_{{cd,b}}+g_{{bd,c}}-g_{{bc,d}}\right) \quad\quad\quad\dots(2)$$

Here, $X$ denotes 4-position (point on the geodesic), $g$ is the metric tensor and $\lambda$ denotes the affine parameter. To make the computation more accurate, easier to follow and modular to implement, we can break down Eq. (1) into two coupled first order ODEs, per coordinate (8 in total - $X^a, U^a$):
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}X^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = U^\alpha \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\dots(3)$$
$$\frac{\mathrm{d}U^\alpha}{\mathrm{d}\lambda} = -\Gamma^\alpha_{\mu\nu}U^\mu U^\nu = A^\alpha \quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\dots(4)$$
Here, $U$ and $A$ are 4-velocity and 4-accelaration, respectively.


#### Geometrized Unit System

Using SI in Numerical Relativity is rather cumbersome due to the huge scales involved. It is better and more "natural" to shift to Geometrized Units, where we set $G = c = 1$ and scale other quantities accordingly. We will be using these units in all the calculations in this module. For ease-of-use, we will let users input the necessary quantities in SI and convert them to Geometric Units implicitly. We will store the final outputs in SI, as well.

A list of scaling factors for SI <-> Geometric can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrized_unit_system).


#### Ray-Tracing

In reality, one has to consider all light rays (*Photons*) close to the BH and evolve them according to the Geodesic Equation (Eq. (1) or (3) & (4)) to see, which *photons* arrive at the observer's position and also, from which direction. This is computationally intractable, given the huge number of initial conditions to consider. To handle this efficiently, we can instead assume, that the observer is located far from the BH and that all rays, arriving at the observer's location, are parallel (as is the case for cosmological observations) and trace the *photon(s)* backwards in time (so-called *Ray-Tracing*), from the observer's location to the BH.


### D. Implementation Details

#### Camera/Image Setup

For Ray-Tracing, we first set up a virtual *Camera/Image*, which represents a consolidated view into what an observer (placed at each pixel of the camera/image) will see. It is a 2D, flat grid of pixels (using the aforementioned assumption), with the overall dimensions given by *Impact Parameters*, $\alpha$ or `alpha` horizontally, and $\beta$ or `beta` vertically. These form the coordinates in the observer's frame. For an observer (at a pixel) who receives the ray (photon) at an inclination angle, $\theta_{Obs}$ (from the BH Spin Axis), and radial position $r_{Obs} \to \infty$, the celestial coordinates in the observerâ€™s frame, $(\alpha$, $\beta)$ can be given by Eqs. (16) and (17) in `Odyssey`. So, we require $\theta_{Obs}$ and $r_{Obs}$, as the inputs for the placement of the null geodesic/photon in the image.


#### Initial Conditions

A summary of the required initial conditions is given below:

| Parameter | Use |
|:---:|:---:|
| `r_obs` | Distance from BH Spin Axis |
| `theta_obs` | Inclination from BH Spin Axis |
| `a` | BH Spin Parameter |
| `alpha` | Horizontal Impact Parameter |
| `beta` | Vertical Impact Parameter |



Mathematically, $r_{Obs} \to \infty$. For practical purposes, we will keep `r_obs` sufficiently large, such that, any spacetime curvature, in the camera/image plane, is less than the numerical tolerance of the simulation - in other words, the flat space approximation for the observer holds.

These parameters can be used to specify the initial conditions for the photon, i.e. its 4-position and 4-momentum (Eqs. (3) & (4)), that we can package together in a vector of length 8 - `initial_photon_vector`. Also, we will have to perform a coordinate tranformation from the observer's frame, at ($\alpha, \beta$) to the BH frame, and then perhaps a transformation to our coordinate system of choice, either BL or KS. For initial conditions and related tasks, we can use the equations in either Section 2.2 of `Odyssey` or Section 2.3 of `RAPTOR`. At each integration step, we will compute the covariant photon momentum and related quantities, and use these values to update a `photon_vector`, that is a length-8 vector, storing values needed for the next integration step. These momentum values ($P_\alpha$ or $k_\alpha$) will be used to perform Radiative Transfer calculations, as described in below, under "Radiative Transfer".

A point to note here is, that the Kerr Spacetime admits 2 Killing Vectors, leading to Energy ($E$) and Angular Momentum ($L_z$) Conservation. Another composite conserved quantity or a constant of motion is Carter's Constant, $Q$. Using these, we can eliminate the calculations, pertaining to time, $t$ and azimuthal angle, $\phi$. This will reduce the number of differential equations to be solved from 8 to 6 (or 5, if axisymmetry is assumed throughout the integration period). However, this is a Kerr-specific optimization, that is not extensible to most spacetimes. Even in Kerr spacetime, realistic models of the BH surroundings require a $\phi$ dependence. So, we can either account for these constants of motion (see `Odyssey` or `EHT Collab`) or be completely general (see `RAPTOR]`).


#### Boundary Conditions

We also need to set limits on the BH itself, as getting too close to the BH would imply photon absorption/capture into the BH. Similarly, some photons may miss the BH by a large distance and evolve infinitely far away from the BH. The lower (or closer) limit can be set, using the equation for Kerr BH Event Horizon, given as follows (in Geometrized units):

$$r_H = M + \sqrt{M^2 + a^2}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\dots(5)$$

This is replaced with the expression for the Inner Most Cicular Orbit (ISCO), which is dependent on $a$, while considering Radiative Transfer calculations, vis-a-vis a Keplerian Disk. As for the outer (or farther) limit, we can set it arbitrarily, depending on the BH features, we wish to study. For example, for a Keplerian Disk, the outer limit is much larger, than for plotting null geodesics.


#### Radiative Transfer

As ray-traced photons travel close to the BH, their intensities, $I_\nu$, change due to frequency shifts caused by the motion of the plasma. To account for this frequency shift, a correction from the observed frequency $I_{\nu,\:Obs}$ to the local frequency $I_\nu$ is required at every point along the ray, because physical processes take place in the local comoving frame. For this portion of the module, we will follow the formulation in Section 3 of `RAPTOR` or Section 2.3 of `Odyssey`. Both papers use the same second order ODE with Optical Depth ($\tau$) as a parameter, however `Odyssey` decouples them into two first order ODEs and `RAPTOR` makes some modifications to make the integration numerically performant. We will be using these modifications. The final set of ODEs, that will be integrated along the geodesic (backward in time), are given below (Eqs. 30 & 31 in `Odyssey` or Eqs. 36 & 37 in `RAPTOR`):

$$\frac{d\tau}{d\lambda} = \gamma^{-1}\alpha_{0,\:\nu}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\dots(6)$$
$$\frac{dI}{d\lambda} = \gamma^{-1}\left(\frac{j_{0,\:\nu}}{\nu^3}\right)\exp(-\tau)\!\!\quad\qquad\dots(7)$$
Here, $j$ and $\alpha$ are respectively, the Emission and Absorption Coefficients, evaluated at a frequency, $\nu$; and $\gamma$ is the Relative Energy Shift, between radiation emitted from material circulating around the black hole, with 4-velocity, $U^\alpha$, and the radiation, that is received by a distant observer (at $\lambda_{Obs}$). It is given as follows:

$$\gamma = \frac{\nu}{\nu_0} = \frac{P_\alpha U^\alpha|_{\lambda_{Obs}}}{P_\alpha U^\alpha|_\lambda}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\:\dots(8)$$

Since, we calculate the covariant 4-momentum ($P_\alpha$ or $k_\alpha$) at each integration step for Eqs. (3) and (4), we can use these values directly to compute $\gamma$. Eq. (8), along with Eqs. (6) and (7) give us the photon intensities.


### E. Notes:

1. In `Gray2`, the authors use KS Coordinates, instead of BL. Their claim is that, this helps with the overall stability of the solver, as we do not have to worry about the polar singularities of BL coordinates. In addition to this, they have opened up Christoffel Symbols, $\Gamma$, into metric derivatives and combined the symmetrized terms, claiming performace improvements, from doing so. These claims need to be verified, but nonetheless provide a potential source of optimization for the module.
2. In this module, we will not include compton scattering, refraction effects and polarization effects due to the plasma. Optical Depth is the main parameter for our plasma models.


### F. Module Structure

I have listed the major structural components of the module below. Please note, that module/class/function names are subject to change, as the module develops.

#### 1. Null Geodesics Integrator

First, we require a `NullGeodesic` class, that inherits from (a modified version of) `einsteinpy.Geodesic`, to solve Eqs. (3) & (4) and get the geodesics. This will be able to simulate a photon sheet, leading to obtaining Black Hole Shadows. A photon sheet is simply a bundle of parallel photons, ray-traced to the BH. For this class, we can have the following structure:
```
NullGeodesic(Geodesic)
|
|--- initialize_photon() : To initialize the length-8 initial_photon_vector, at a particular pixel in the camera/image
|
|--- _stepsize() : Calculates optimal step-size, for the next integration step (Based on `RAPTOR`'s implementation)
|
|--- _connection_coef() : To calculate metric derivatives or Christoffel Symbols
|
|--- integrate() : Moves integration by 1 step
|                : Calls all 3 methods
```

For `integrate()`, possible pathways are:
1. Implement our own solver. Some preferable ones are:
   1. RK45, with adaptive meshing: Higher accuracy, Stabler, Slower
   2. Verlet Integrator: Lower accuracy, Faster
   3. Adam-Bashforth-Moulton (Predictor-Corrector) Method: Medium accuracy, Most stable, Medium speed
2. Use solvers provided in `scipy.integrate`, like:
   1. `solve_ivp`
   2. `odeint`
   3. `RK45`

   

#### 2. Time-Independent Radiative Transfer

For this portion, we will create a `RadiativeTransfer()` class, that will inherit `NullGeodesic()` from earlier. We can have the following structure for this class:

***To be updated***

```
RadiativeTransfer(NullGeodesic)
|
|--- _initialize_photon() : 
|
```

A noteworthy point is, if we decide to go with a `RAPTOR`-like implementation with simultaneous geodesic and radiative transfer integration, `numba` optimizations may be insufficient and we may have to go with CUDA/GPU code. For this, we can use `cuPy` or `dask`.
