# Repository to store my research into implementing Null Geodesics in einsteinpy

## CURRENT PLAN:
1. Read the papers.
2. Make a comparison table. (Check `review.md` for this)
    * Sync the order of papers in `status.ipynb`, with `review.md`.
3. Check the software/code (if any). (Check `status.ipynb` for this)
4. Check the math in the best papers.
5. Check conversion to code viability (in terms of math complexity et al)

#### N.B.: I intend to make this repo public, after the GSoC selections are over. For now, [this repo has no license.](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1720/what-can-i-assume-if-a-publicly-published-project-has-no-license)
