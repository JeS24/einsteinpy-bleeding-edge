# Repository to store my research into implementing Null Geodesics in einsteinpy

## CURRENT PLAN:
1. Read the papers.
2. Sync the order of papers in [`status.ipynb`](https://github.com/JeS24/einsteinpy-bleeding-edge/blob/master/status.ipynb), with [`review.md`](https://github.com/JeS24/einsteinpy-bleeding-edge/blob/master/review.md).
3. Make a comparison table. (Check [`review.md`](https://github.com/JeS24/einsteinpy-bleeding-edge/blob/master/review.md) for this)
4. Check the software/code (if any). (Check [`status.ipynb`](https://github.com/JeS24/einsteinpy-bleeding-edge/blob/master/status.ipynb) for this)
5. Check the math in the best papers.
6. Check conversion to code viability (in terms of math complexity et al)

#### N.B.: I intend to make this repo public, after the GSoC selections are over. For now, [this repo has no license.](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/questions/1720/what-can-i-assume-if-a-publicly-published-project-has-no-license)
